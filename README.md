# C++ Modules

This repository contains a series of C++ exercises from the 42 common core, organized into modules from `cpp00` to `cpp09`. Each module covers specific topics to progressively develop a solid understanding of C++ programming.

## ðŸ“Œ Module Overview

- **`cpp00`**: Introduction to C++ specificities compared to C, including concepts such as classes, namespaces, overloading, and the use of `const` and `static` qualifiers.

- **`cpp01`**: Memory management, references, pointers to members, and the use of `switch` statements.

- **`cpp02`**: Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, and implementation of orthodox canonical classes.

- **`cpp03`**: Inheritance concepts, focusing on how to create and manage derived classes.

- **`cpp04`**: Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces.

- **`cpp05`**: Exception handling using `try`, `catch`, and `throw` to write robust and error-resistant code.

- **`cpp06`**: Different types of casting in C++, including `static_cast`, `dynamic_cast`, `const_cast`, and `reinterpret_cast`.

- **`cpp07`**: Introduction to templates, enabling the creation of functions and classes that work with any data type.

- **`cpp08`**: In-depth study of the Standard Template Library (STL), including containers, iterators, and the algorithm library.

- **`cpp09`**: Practical implementation of containers, applying knowledge acquired in previous modules to solve more complex problems.
